# Wrath Base Final Stand: (Base inherits Worldscar Caldera via Path? )

Base Wrath does not have a unique pre-reform Final Stand; Final Stand unlock occurs post-subclass selection. See subclass Final Stand documents.

(If design shifts to allow base Final Stand, clone simplified molten upheaval without revival.)
