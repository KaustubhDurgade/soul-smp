Perfect! Hereâ€™s a **full SMP Mythics Catalog**, formatted like the Contracts blueprint, giving you a **ready-to-implement reference** for your plugin. I included **name, type, active/passive effect, resonance interactions, particle/display ideas, and tier/duration**.

## **Implementation Notes**

1. **Activation / Passive**

   * Weapons & Transformations: right-click / keybind for active; passive always applies while equipped.
   * Artifacts & Armor: passive effects continuous; active abilities can have cooldowns.
   * World Mythics: triggered by event or activation, visually dominates the area.

2. **Particle & Display**

   * **Weapons:** streaks, arcs, AoE bursts
   * **Artifacts:** floating orbs, sigils, rotating runes
   * **Transformations:** full-body particle wrap, elemental aura, armorstand projections
   * **World-effects:** domes, meteor strikes, elemental storms, terrain overlays

3. **Scaling / Resonances**

   * Effects scale with:

     * Nearby players / number of souls
     * Active resonances or contracts
     * Player level or mythic rarity tier
   * Example: Dragonâ€™s Heart AoE damage = Base Ã— (1 + 0.2 Ã— # Flame+Wind souls nearby)

4. **Tiering**

   * **Tier 2:** Strong, regional effects, moderate duration, enhances multiple abilities/resonances
   * **Tier 3:** Cataclysmic, massive area, long duration, visually spectacular, multi-soul or world-altering

This catalog gives you a **plug-and-play list of Mythics** with:

* **Name & type**
* **Effects** (active/passive)
* **Resonance interactions**
* **Visual / particle concepts**
* **Tier / duration**

Itâ€™s ready to be **integrated into your SMP plugin framework**, interacting with **souls, contracts, and events**.

If you want, the **next step** could be me **designing a unified SMP system architecture**, showing **how all 13 souls, abilities, resonances, contracts, events, and mythics interact dynamically**, with **data flow, tick scheduling, and modular plugin structure**.

Do you want me to do that next?
