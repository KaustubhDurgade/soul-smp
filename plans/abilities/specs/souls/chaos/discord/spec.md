# Soul of Chaos – Path of Discord (Resource: Entropy)

Philosophy: Amplify randomness through cascading effects and deliberate chaos spreading.

Resource – Entropy
- Cap: 100
- Gain: Debuff spreads (Entropic Gift proc +3), Wild Surge backlash events (+5), Reality Fracture negative outcomes (+8), enemy abilities failing due to your debuff interference (+2).
- Spend: Reality Fracture bias (50 Entropy = +1 tier shift, cannot exceed +4 cap).
- Decay: 2 per 8s out of combat.
- Synergy: High Entropy (≥60) reduces backlash chances by 15% across all Discord abilities.

Ability Kit

P – Entropic Gift
- Positive Buff Extension: All beneficial random effects (from base Chaotic Aura, allied abilities, consumables) last +50% duration when applied to you. Caps at +12s extension per effect to prevent infinite stacking.
- Debuff Propagation: When you apply any debuff (direct cast, weapon proc, aura effect), 25% chance to spread a copy to random enemy within radius 3 of original target. Spread copy has half remaining duration (minimum 1s). Max 1 spread per cast to prevent chain reactions.
- Spread Mechanics: Selects highest-threat enemy within range; if tied, prioritizes lowest current HP. Immunity: same debuff type cannot spread to same target within 8s (ICD tracking).
- Entropy Generation: Each successful spread grants +3 Entropy.

T – Wild Surge (16s cooldown)
- Target Selection: Single entity within range 10 (line of sight required).
- Outcome Resolution:
  1. Ally Boost (60%): +15% damage dealt & +8% damage reduction for 6s. Stacks with other percentage modifiers multiplicatively. Grants target Speed I for 3s.
  2. Enemy Debuff (35%): -15% damage dealt & +8% damage taken for 6s. Applies Entropy Mark (cosmetic glow) enabling other Discord abilities to prioritize this target.
  3. Backlash (5%): Self Silence 2s + lose 10 Entropy if >10, else gain +5 Entropy (failure compensation). Refund 25% cooldown.
- Range Extension: At ≥70 Entropy, range increases to 14 blocks.
- Smart Targeting: If crosshair on ally, bias toward Ally Boost (+20% weight); if on enemy, bias toward Enemy Debuff (+15% weight).

M – Chaotic Sprint (14s cooldown)
- Activation: Gain Speed III for 4s + particle trail effect.
- Patch Generation: Each second (4 total) leaves random patch at your position:
  1. Slow Patch (30%): Radius 2, 25% slow for 3s.
  2. Explosion Patch (25%): 0.5s delay then 2 HP damage radius 1.5 + minor knock.
  3. Heal Patch (25%): Allies stepping on it gain 1 heart + cleanse 1 debuff.
  4. Smoke Patch (20%): Radius 2.5, Blind 1s on entry + obscured vision.
- Patch Persistence: 6s unless triggered (Heal Patch consumed on use).
- Entropy Interaction: At ≥50 Entropy, each patch has 15% chance to upgrade: Slow→Root 1s, Explosion→4 HP, Heal→2 hearts + Regen I 3s, Smoke→Blind 2s + Confusion 1s.
- Sprint Stacking: Cannot recast while active; attempting grants +1s duration instead.

U – Reality Fracture (135s cooldown)
- Fracture Roll: d9 outcome (-4 to +4) with bell curve distribution (weights: 1,2,4,8,12,8,4,2,1).
- Outcome Effects:
  - (-4): Self 10 HP + Silence 4s + lose 20 Entropy
  - (-3): Self 6 HP + Weakness II 3s
  - (-2): Nothing (null effect)
  - (-1): Minor 4 HP AOE radius 3
  - (0): Null (cosmetic fracture effect only)
  - (+1): 6 HP AOE radius 4
  - (+2): 10 HP AOE radius 5 + Slow II 3s
  - (+3): 14 HP AOE radius 6 + knockback 2 blocks
  - (+4): Cataclysm 20 HP true damage (cap 14 per target) radius 8 + pulls 1 block/s for 2s
- Entropy Bias: Spend 50 Entropy to shift roll +1 tier (cannot exceed +4). Multiple spends allowed if sufficient Entropy.
- Safety Caps: Cataclysm cannot target allies; self-damage outcomes cannot reduce below 1 HP.
- Fracture Residue: Negative outcomes leave 4s 'Fracture Scar' granting +15% damage to next ability.

Wpn – Entropy Shard
- Base Weapon: Moderate damage scaling.
- Random Proc (30% on hit):
  1. Self Heal (25%): +1 heart
  2. Bonus Damage (35%): +2 HP to hit target
  3. Apply Slow (25%): 1s slow to target
  4. Self Harm (15%): -1 HP to self + gain +2 Entropy
- Entropy Scaling: At ≥80 Entropy, proc chance increases to 45%.
- Proc Chain: Cannot proc on same target within 3s to prevent spam.

FS – Rift Cataclysm (Per life)
- Trigger: On death (≤2s after lethal damage).
- Rift Field: Radius 10, duration 15s, cycles through 5 anomaly phases (3s each):
  1. Pull Phase: 0.8 block/s inward
  2. Knock Phase: Radial knockback 1.5 blocks
  3. Buff Phase: Random beneficial effect to allies inside
  4. Debuff Phase: Random detrimental effect to enemies inside
  5. Chaos Phase: Mixed random effects
- Reform Condition: If 4+ complete anomaly cycles occur without you taking damage from enemy abilities, reform at 30% HP at field center.
- Persistence: If reform fails, field becomes permanent terrain feature (25 real minutes) spawning minor Instability surges every 20s (random small effects within radius 5).
- Immunity: Reformed player gains 3s damage immunity and 10s displacement immunity.
- Interaction: Other Chaos souls gain +15% resource generation while inside persistent field.
