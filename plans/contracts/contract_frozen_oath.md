## Summary
Sacrifice mobility and a frost item to project a chilling field that briefly freezes enemies then slows them.

## Mechanics
* On activation, player rooted for mobility_lock_seconds.
* Field snapshot persists for duration (implicit from freeze + slow tail ~6.5s).

## Scaling
Extra Silence souls extend freeze duration (cap 3.5s).

## Resonance Hooks
Frost+Silence â†’ +1s freeze (still capped).

## Visuals
Icy rune ring, falling shard particles, faint mist dome.

## Anti-Abuse & Conflicts
Per-target freeze immunity for 8s after effect end.

## Edge Cases
* Entities already frozen refresh remaining shorter or extend if lower.
* Boss-class flagged as "freeze_resistant": treat as 40% slow instead.

## Implementation Notes
Use per-entity metadata for immunity timestamp.
