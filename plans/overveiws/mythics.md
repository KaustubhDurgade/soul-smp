# ðŸŒŒ Mythic System â€“ Structured Specification (Step 1.0 â†’ 2.0 Ready)

Mythics are apex items / transformations / world anchors that create limited, high-impact windows of altered gameplay. They must never become mandatory baselines; they are strategic accelerators with strict acquisition friction and stacking guardrails.

---

## 0. Design Goals
* Singular Identity (each mythic solves a unique combat / support niche)
* Windowed Power (bursts or sustained passives within controlled bands)
* Multi-System Fusion (always interacts with at least one of: resonance, contract, event)
* Predictable Counterplay (visual clarity, telegraphs, cooldown readability)
* Data-Driven Scalability (no bespoke code branches per mythic)

---

## 1. Taxonomy
| Field | Values | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| mythic_type | WEAPON, ARTIFACT, ARMOR, TRANSFORMATION, WORLD_OBJECT, CATALYST | Drives activation + persistence rules |
| tier | 2, 3 (mythics start high) | Tier influences visual + stacking ceilings |
| activation_mode | PASSIVE_ONLY, ACTIVE_WINDOW, TRANSFORM, WORLD_DEPLOY | Behavior lifecycle |
| acquisition_path | EVENT_DROP, CRAFT_INFUSION, CONTRACT_FUSION, BOSS_REWARD, WORLD_TRIGGER | Balancing levers |
| soul_focus | list(souls) or ANY | Used for affinity & attunement |
| limited_flag | true/false | If true, server-limited count concurrently |

---

## 3. Lifecycle
```
IDLE â†’ (Acquire) â†’ EQUIPPED (passives maybe) â†’ ACTIVATION_CHECK (cooldown OK) â†’ WINDUP â†’ ACTIVE_WINDOW / TRANSFORMED â†’ REVERT â†’ COOLDOWN â†’ EQUIPPED
```
World objects (e.g., Eclipse Totem) substitute REVERT with DESPAWN.

---

## 4. Attunement & Exclusive Slots
* Mythics occupy special attunement channels (e.g., transformation_core, world_anchor)
* A player may attune to at most ONE from each exclusive channel
* Attempt to activate when channel occupied â†’ UI feedback (deny + reason)

---

## 5. Stacking & Conflict Rules
| Domain | Rule |
|--------|------|
| silence_amp | Strongest_only |
| transformation | Only 1 active transformation per player |
| world_anchor_dark | Max 1 within 64 blocks |
| cooldown_mass_reducer | Additive â†’ multiplicative beyond 40% |

Mythic declares `conflict_tags`, engine enforces at activation or merges with diminishing table.

---

## 6. Acquisition Philosophy
| Path | Intent | Control Lever |
|------|--------|---------------|
| EVENT_DROP | Link to macro world pacing | Drop weight & bad luck protection |
| CRAFT_INFUSION | Long-term progression | Essence costs & gating components |
| CONTRACT_FUSION | Group cooperative ritual | Sacrifice totals & ritual timing risk |
| BOSS_REWARD | High-challenge success | Boss token economy |
| WORLD_TRIGGER | Exploration reward | Hidden structure spawn rate |

Bad luck protection increments chance after each failed eligible participation.

---

## 7. Power Budgeting
| Tier | Active Window (s) | Passive Budget (approx stat units) | Visual Layers | Cooldown Band |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2 | 8â€“12 | 1.0 (baseline) | â‰¤3 | 180â€“300 |
| 3 | 10â€“18 | 1.35 | â‰¤5 | 300â€“480 |

Stat Units: Normalized equivalence bucket (e.g., +5% ability dmg = 0.25 unit) used to keep builds balanced.

---

## 8. Visual Degrade Ladder
1. Ambient aura density
2. Secondary wing/halo trails
3. Ground sigil pulses
4. Large volumetric displays

When server performance inspector flags degrade-mode, steps apply globally to mythics.

## 9. Mythic Catalog

Earlier detailed table remains valid; this catalog normalizes it into registry perspective.

## 10. Anti-Abuse / Safeguards
* Transform revert cooldown prevents burst weaving
* World objects limited per region & per-player deploy rate
* Cooldown compression stacking respects contract + artifact diminishing rules
* Passive amplifiers (Soul Prism) follow absolute duration caps after merges
* Telemetry auto-flags mythics with >X% participation dominance

---

## 11. Telemetry
* acquisition_source_distribution
* average_active_window_utilization
* transformation_cancel_rate
* conflict_denial_count
* visual_degrade_invocations

---

## 12. Implementation Checklist
1. Mythic registry loader (with structural validation)
2. Exclusive slot / attunement service integration
3. Activation pipeline (conflict -> gating -> activation -> revert)
4. Transformation harness (model swap & ability override binding)
5. World object deployer (region occupancy tracking)
6. Visual degrade orchestrator reuse
7. Telemetry + admin introspection commands
